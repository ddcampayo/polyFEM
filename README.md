# polyFEM

A free and open source pFEM simulation tool, based on the CGAL libs.

This branch covers the procedure of "assignment": transferring information
from a set of moving particles onto a fixed mesh, and back

For different simulations, simply copy any of the "main" files and name it
"main.cpp". Then, run "source cmake-4.8.sh", and "make"
